# Jablko Mod: Hamster Monitor

This Jablko mod communicates with a wireless microcontroller (eg. ESP8266) to sense if a hamster is active and provides a UI display for a Jablko dashboard.

This module is part of the early development process of Jablko. This means that it's update cycle will be frequent and potentially non-backwards compatible.
